  XGELS 3.0! I merged my app drawer reimplementation to the public build. So you can use the app drawer tweaks again!<br><br>

  Unfortunately Google started rebuilding the launcher again. I haven't been able to fix everything. Currently I can only support GNow up to 5.10.32.<br><br>

  Please consider XGELS Premium to support the development of this app!<br>Thanks so much!<br><br>

  !Added:
    * support for Google Search 5.9.29 and 5.10.22/23/25/30/32
    * app drawer tweaks working again (up to 5.10.32)
    * <b>Gesture:</b> swipe left/right to go through tabs
    * <b>Gestures:</b> Search app drawer action
    * Android Integration tweaks for Android Marshmallow

  !Fixed:
    * search bar not hiding
    * custom icon not loading
    * reboot launcher

  !Misc:
    * many internal restructures

  !Known issue:
    * GNow 5.11 broke a lot of things, it's not supported yet
    * calendar icon does not change in folders or app drawer
    * app drawer open and close animation broken, I'm not sure if this can be fixed.
    * horizontal app drawer padding is bugged
    * move tabs to bottom does not work
